# Parsing Artists JSON

This exercise will take a few steps to complete successfully. Have a look at the `artists.json` file before starting so you have an idea of the structure and information contained.

Parse the JSON file into a Python dictionary.

Unpack the `bio` column into a DataFrame.

Create a `df` variable containing only artists that have greater than 150 paintings in their career.

This JSON was originally a CSV file from Kaggle and has been altered for this course, https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time
